## How can I stake MY?

You can stake your MYC in Myteamex Syrup Pools. Visit the Syrup Pools page.

Read our [How to Stake in Syrup Pools guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Syrup Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more MYC by supporting Myteamex.

Staking only needs some MYC to be added to a Syrup Pool to earn MYC or other tokens.  
Learn more about Syrup Pool staking.

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn MYC  
Learn more about Yield Farming.

## How do I farm?

We have a Yield Farming guide if you're interested in learning how to farm.

## What's the best wallet for Myteamex?

It depends on your needs. We have an in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet that's right for you.

New Pools are added to Myteamex frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on PancakeSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to PancakeSwap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## What is the max supply of MYC?

$MYC does not have a maximum supply. The circulating supply is managed through built-in burning and regular burning events.
